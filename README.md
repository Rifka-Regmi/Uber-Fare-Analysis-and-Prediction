The objective of this project is to analyze Uber trip data to uncover key insights and build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting Uber fare amounts based on trip characteristics such as distance, time, and date.

- Loaded Uber trip data, handled missing values, and removed irrelevant columns to ensure data quality.
- Calculated trip distances using geodesic formulas and extracted temporal features such as hour, day, and month from the pickup datetime to enrich the dataset.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships, including visualizations like heatmaps for correlation analysis and scatter plots to examine fare amounts relative to distances.
- Performed feature selection and data scaling, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to prepare for machine learning model development aimed at predicting Uber fare amounts.
